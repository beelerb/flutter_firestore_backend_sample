# flutter_firestore_example
"Using Firestore as a backend to your Flutter app" (https://youtu.be/DqJ_KjFzL9I) code samples.

I've added this code for the edification of others and is a work in progress. As Flutter et al is a moving target this could quite likely be out of date by March 2019 (2019-03-01). 

Adding "cloud_firestore: ^0.8.1" to pubspec.yaml file also helped.

The error "registerResGeneratingTask is deprecated, use registerGeneratedResFolders(FileCollection)" comes upbut the app still runs.
